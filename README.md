Gym
---
Gym is an open source PHP library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API.

Original source codes are the [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).

This is a port of the Python source code to PHP code.
